This repository contains the scripts we'll be using for the Geospatial Workshop Part 3: Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R, on April 19th, 2022. 

###Completed
The Completed folder contains completed scripts used during the lesson's episodes for reference by the instructor and learners. Note that some of the code has been changed from the [original content for the Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/).

###Working
The Working folder contains just the comments from the completed scripts, to guide the instructor and learners in live-coding from the [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) lesson.

###Recommended Setup
I recommend learners follow the steps in the [Project Management with RStudio](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/02-project-intro/index.html)episode of the [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/) lesson to set up their R project and directory folders, especially:
- The steps under "Challenge: Creating a self-contained project" to create a new project and directory called `r-geospatial`.
- The steps under "Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing" to create the folders: `doc`,`data`,`results`,`src`, and `bin`.

###Using these scripts in RStudio
Although you can just download these scripts and import them into RStudio manually, I recommend learners follow the recommended setup steps above, then download and unzip this repository into the `src` folder in your `r-geospatial` repository. 

Note that the data files used in these scripts are located directly in the `data` repository/folder; when you unzip the data files, it may add an extra folder. You can either move the data files out into the `data` folder, or change the script to match the path to your data files.
